Where the world and character building were heavily developed in the first book, this one pushed deeper toward the plot. The writing style is similar in that there is a heavy dose of narrative exposition mixed in with more active and gripping scenes. The modern reader might have some difficulty with this book; having developed an attention span corrupted by the entertainment industry. Its not super fluid and fast paced. Sometimes it bogs down before picking back up. And yet, for those who are patient enough they can come away with a solidly built world and well defined characters. More importantly, they can come away with a deeper and richer experience. I wonder sometimes that, if The Lord of the Ring had been released today, would it be considered a flop? With heavy exposition and info dumping, would it survive the modern critic? And yet, for those who have the patience, they are richly rewarded. While Robin Hobb isn't J.R.R. Tolkien, she does grasp many of the skills that enrich more than simply entertain. For this, I gladly give Royal Assassin 5-stars, and eagerly await reading the third and last book in this trilogy.</td>\n",

I hope to see more of Hakeswill in future Cornwell books, though am sure soon the character will become old and tired and have to be killed off.  Robert Knowles is back, its nice to see some previous characters, and to see how they have developed.\\nThe book is based around the siege of Badajoz, a bloody battle with an infamous ending.  As with all Sharpe books you get an insight into the history of the British army, its refreshing to get an insight into the British army back in the 1800's that not from Hollywood (the murderous soldiers in the patriot etc...).  The British army prevented the world becoming one big French Empire in a campaign that today is largely forgotten.  Many people talk of Napoleon as the greatest military tactician of his time, but many people don't remember how Lord Wellington beat he and his marshal's.  This series of books really brings that great part of British history home.\\nA great installment of Sharpe</td>\n",

In light of this, I find it very interesting to see how different authors see what the future holds, not only for our country, but for our planet. Most of these series, however, are geared to teens and young adults. Therefore, I Googled \"Adult Dystopian Novels,\" and to my delight, there was a large list. I researched each book and \"When She Woke\" really interested me. After reading it, I can honestly say that it was one of the most thought-provoking books I have ever read and has earned a spot on my shelf as one of my favorites.\\n\\nWithout giving too much away, be prepared to evaluate and change some of your political and religious beliefs. This book takes place after a second Great Depression when America has become a theocracy. Christianity is really the only religion and Roe vs. Wade has been reversed. In other words, everything that Christians, including myself, have been praying for. Abortions are considered murder and women who have them are convicted of murder and punished as such. Every felon is injected with a virus that turns their skin a color that coincides with that particular felony. Murderers and attempted murderers are red, drug convictions are yellow, etc. If you read only one book this year, make it this one. Ms. Jordan has really outdone herself on this her second novel.

       "      <td>For those of you that are familiar with the Lady of the Manners' column, the short review is that you'll love the book.  You'll find classic lessons revisited, such as manners towards curious bystanders, etiquette, and the old \"Why friends don't let friends dress like The Crow\".  I personally enjoyed her list of favorite vampire books, as she and I share the same liking for them.\\n\\nFor those of you who don't know Jillian Venters, she is a classy columnist and a member of the Goth community for quite some time.  With this book she tries to teach the essentials of Goth to those who are not familiar with the term, as well as explaining to familiars, friends and coworkers of goths the inside of the subculture.  She provides too with lists of \"typically goth\" music, films and books.  All of it written in an informal and educative manner, while the drawings of Pete Venters provide a lovely background to the text.  There is a bit of everything, from swirly bats to decorated pages' numbers, cartoons...  My personal favorite was the collection of different types of goth girls (in which I saw myself depicted a couple of times!).\\n\\nAn essential book for those that are curious about Goth.</td>\n",

BUT, it is a good read and Mr. Iles's writing is top notch.  It takes a lot for me to cringe while reading a novel, and this novel did just that.  Yes, the topic of human trafficking and dog fighting is not for everyone but Mr. Iles put this book together and made it work.  Bravo to Mr. Iles and can't wait till the next Penn Cage novel to come out.  I own and have real all of Greg Iles novels and I am sure he will not disappoint.</td>\n",

The twist that happens didn't really sink in for me until I was reading the last chapter 10 minutes later and even though throughout this entire series I was not in love with these books Veronica Roth had me heart broken by the way she ended it and yet I don't believe she could have ended it better. I was suspecting a stupid 'teen girl ending' like twilight and hunger games where all that really happens is the two lovers end up together in the end.

( Don't worry im not depressed!!) I absolutely loved these books, and am now a huge fan of Helen Dunmore. I got The Deep first, and loved it but was a little confused until i learned it was the third book and not the first! Dunmore's skill of writing put me in a trance like state when i read her books, and i found myself dreaming of Ingo, hoping to wake up floating among the Mer. I became so in love with the books, that i found myself in WALMART singing, \"I wish i was away in Ingo, far across the briney sea, sailing over deepest waters where care nor love troubles thee!\" Passerbys may have thought me a few nuggets short of a happy meal, but i was happily in my daydream.

       "      <td>Michael Korda devotes little space to the personal stories of individuals who actually comprised the Few who successfully thwarted the German invasion of Great Britain; instead, he concentrates his treatment of the famous battles in the air during the summer of 1940 on the men who developed the strategy necessary to meet the challenge. Churchill, Beaverbrook, Leigh-Mallory, Park, Douglas, Mitchell, and Camm are naturally given prominence for their work as Prime Minister, aviation production manager, group air commanders, and aviation designers; however, it is Air Chief Marshal Sir Hugh Dowding who commands the greatest attention-of whom it was later said,\"To him the people of Britain and the free world owe largely the way of life and the liberties that they enjoy today\".\\n\\nIt was Dowding, that the author and others who came to recognize the invaluable service of Dowding, who developed and implemented the grouping and sectoring of the home island's Spitfires and Hurricanes; who held appreciable numbers of fighter planes in reserve to deceive Goring into believing that the RAF had fewer planes than they actually had; who convinced the powers to be of the significant importance of radar and the burying of communication cables sheltered from enemy bombs; who coordinated the use of aerial spotters and the home guard; and who blended indivduals whose temperments were contrary to meeting the needed goals and objectives.\\n\\nYes, the Battle of Britain was his story and the end results changed the course of the war and in turn world history. Korda has given the focus where it belongs even though at the time it seemed that Dowding's overbearing style might prove to be his undoing. His vision never at the time was fully accepted, but the years that followed proved him to be both a prophet and rescuer.</td>\n",

I rated the first book 4 stars, but this one ended up engaging me more. Where the world and character building were heavily developed in the first book, this one pushed deeper toward the plot. The writing style is similar in that there is a heavy dose of narrative exposition mixed in with more active and gripping scenes. The modern reader might have some difficulty with this book; having developed an attention span corrupted by the entertainment industry. Its not super fluid and fast paced. Sometimes it bogs down before picking back up. And yet, for those who are patient enough they can come away with a solidly built world and well defined characters. More importantly, they can come away with a deeper and richer experience. I wonder sometimes that, if The Lord of the Ring had been released today, would it be considered a flop? With heavy exposition and info dumping, would it survive the modern critic? And yet, for those who have the patience, they are richly rewarded. While Robin Hobb isn't J.R.R. Tolkien, she does grasp many of the skills that enrich more than simply entertain. For this, I gladly give Royal Assassin 5-stars, and eagerly await reading the third and last book in this trilogy.   \n",

This book was, as he admits on his website, only half of a book and to add insult to injury he wants his fans to stop bugging him because he will finish the other half when he gets round to it. Since his last update on his own site was January 2008 when he said that he had no idea when the next volume, which will bring the series about half way would be finished, I would not hold my breath. Personally I shall be boycotting his books in future.   \n",

I hope to see more of Hakeswill in future Cornwell books, though am sure soon the character will become old and tired and have to be killed off.  Robert Knowles is back, its nice to see some previous characters, and to see how they have developed.\\nThe book is based around the siege of Badajoz, a bloody battle with an infamous ending.  As with all Sharpe books you get an insight into the history of the British army, its refreshing to get an insight into the British army back in the 1800's that not from Hollywood (the murderous soldiers in the patriot etc...).  The British army prevented the world becoming one big French Empire in a campaign that today is largely forgotten.  Many people talk of Napoleon as the greatest military tactician of his time, but many people don't remember how Lord Wellington beat he and his marshal's.  This series of books really brings that great part of British history home.\\nA great installment of Sharpe   \n",

Our society is quickly headed down a road that is going to lead to disaster unless we stand up and force changes. In light of this, I find it very interesting to see how different authors see what the future holds, not only for our country, but for our planet. Most of these series, however, are geared to teens and young adults. Therefore, I Googled \"Adult Dystopian Novels,\" and to my delight, there was a large list. I researched each book and \"When She Woke\" really interested me. After reading it, I can honestly say that it was one of the most thought-provoking books I have ever read and has earned a spot on my shelf as one of my favorites.\\n\\nWithout giving too much away, be prepared to evaluate and change some of your political and religious beliefs. This book takes place after a second Great Depression when America has become a theocracy. Christianity is really the only religion and Roe vs. Wade has been reversed. In other words, everything that Christians, including myself, have been praying for. Abortions are considered murder and women who have them are convicted of murder and punished as such. Every felon is injected with a virus that turns their skin a color that coincides with that particular felony. Murderers and attempted murderers are red, drug convictions are yellow, etc. If you read only one book this year, make it this one. Ms. Jordan has really outdone herself on this her second novel. This is destined to be a classic!   \n",

I personally enjoyed her list of favorite vampire books, as she and I share the same liking for them.\\n\\nFor those of you who don't know Jillian Venters, she is a classy columnist and a member of the Goth community for quite some time.  With this book she tries to teach the essentials of Goth to those who are not familiar with the term, as well as explaining to familiars, friends and coworkers of goths the inside of the subculture.  She provides too with lists of \"typically goth\" music, films and books.  All of it written in an informal and educative manner, while the drawings of Pete Venters provide a lovely background to the text.  There is a bit of everything, from swirly bats to decorated pages' numbers, cartoons...  My personal favorite was the collection of different types of goth girls (in which I saw myself depicted a couple of times!).\\n\\nAn essential book for those that are curious about Goth.   \n",

BUT, it is a good read and Mr. Iles's writing is top notch.  It takes a lot for me to cringe while reading a novel, and this novel did just that.  Yes, the topic of human trafficking and dog fighting is not for everyone but Mr. Iles put this book together and made it work.  Bravo to Mr. Iles and can't wait till the next Penn Cage novel to come out.  I own and have real all of Greg Iles novels and I am sure he will not disappoint.   \n",

The twist that happens didn't really sink in for me until I was reading the last chapter 10 minutes later and even though throughout this entire series I was not in love with these books Veronica Roth had me heart broken by the way she ended it and yet I don't believe she could have ended it better. I was suspecting a stupid 'teen girl ending' like twilight and hunger games where all that really happens is the two lovers end up together in the end. Overall a dissapointing book because she didn't actually study the topic that she was writing about but enjoyed the end.   \n",

I was so obsessed with the books my fanily thought i was depressed because i would stay in my room all day reading them!! ( Don't worry im not depressed!!) I absolutely loved these books, and am now a huge fan of Helen Dunmore. I got The Deep first, and loved it but was a little confused until i learned it was the third book and not the first! Dunmore's skill of writing put me in a trance like state when i read her books, and i found myself dreaming of Ingo, hoping to wake up floating among the Mer. I became so in love with the books, that i found myself in WALMART singing, \"I wish i was away in Ingo, far across the briney sea, sailing over deepest waters where care nor love troubles thee!\" Passerbys may have thought me a few nuggets short of a happy meal, but i was happily in my daydream. I recomend this series to anyone who likes deep, meaningful books, and stories that excite and captivate you.   \n",
       "881805  Michael Korda devotes little space to the personal stories of individuals who actually comprised the Few who successfully thwarted the German invasion of Great Britain; instead, he concentrates his treatment of the famous battles in the air during the summer of 1940 on the men who developed the strategy necessary to meet the challenge. Churchill, Beaverbrook, Leigh-Mallory, Park, Douglas, Mitchell, and Camm are naturally given prominence for their work as Prime Minister, aviation production manager, group air commanders, and aviation designers; however, it is Air Chief Marshal Sir Hugh Dowding who commands the greatest attention-of whom it was later said,\"To him the people of Britain and the free world owe largely the way of life and the liberties that they enjoy today\".\\n\\nIt was Dowding, that the author and others who came to recognize the invaluable service of Dowding, who developed and implemented the grouping and sectoring of the home island's Spitfires and Hurricanes; who held appreciable numbers of fighter planes in reserve to deceive Goring into believing that the RAF had fewer planes than they actually had; who convinced the powers to be of the significant importance of radar and the burying of communication cables sheltered from enemy bombs; who coordinated the use of aerial spotters and the home guard; and who blended indivduals whose temperments were contrary to meeting the needed goals and objectives.\\n\\nYes, the Battle of Britain was his story and the end results changed the course of the war and in turn world history. Korda has given the focus where it belongs even though at the time it seemed that Dowding's overbearing style might prove to be his undoing. His vision never at the time was fully accepted, but the years that followed proved him to be both a prophet and rescuer.   \n",
