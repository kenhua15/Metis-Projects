## Metis Project 5: Collaborative Filtering Book Recommendation System using Amazon Review Data

#### This project is part of the Metis Natural Language Processing and Unsupervised Learning module

I built an end to end Book recommendation system from Amazon review data. I used NLP (NLTK, TextBlob, Flair) to analyze sentiment in Amazon review data. From these sentiments, I was able to build a collaborative filtering model that was trained using Neural Networks. The model is able to provide predictions on user-book interactions, and allows the system to recommend books to users that they have not read on. Examples are shown in the directory.
