## Metis Project 2: Linear Regression Analysis using Targeted Topic Modeling

#### This project is part of the Metis Web Scraping and Regression module.

In this project, I am utilizing Yelp Open API data + Zip Code data to understand how features such as city statistics and sentiment analysis
of user reviews to understand what features effect the Rating (1-5) that users give to restaurants. The contents can be found described below,
and each notebook file details the entire process of this project.


The Towards Data Science Medium Article - [Simple method of targeted TF-IDF topic modeling using Yelp Open DataSet](https://medium.com/@kenhua15/simple-method-of-targeted-tf-idf-topic-modeling-using-yelp-open-dataset-298e019d6c09) was a more polished extension of the original project. The workflow for this project can be followed along at Final_Notebook.ipynb. 


Here are descriptions of the contents of each folder

#### code

1. 1_Web_Scraping.ipynb: Code detailing webscraping of zip code data from zipdatamaps.com

2. 2_Data_Cleaning.ipynb: Code detailing data cleaning process, including data merging from different sources and sentiment analysis of yelp reviews using NLP tools.

3. 3_Regression_Analysis.ipynb: Code detailing regression analysis, including exploratory regression analysis, validating of assumptions, cross validation, and model selection.
