#### Project 1: Scheduling Maintenance w/ MTA Turnstile Data

Using SQL, pandas and matplotlib, processed 3 years of MTA turnstile data to identify the optimal times for scheduling maintenance projects. Provided visualization with explanation for recommendations.

#### Project 2: Yelp Comment Sentiment Analysis for Regression

I used Sentiment Analysis and NLP to build features from Yelp Review Comments. These features were used in Regression models to identify strong text features and predict User Review Ratings. I used Pandas, NLTK, Vader, BeautifulSoup, Selenium to build this project from Yelp Open API Data.

#### Project 3: Predicting Real Estate Growth w/ Tableau

As part of the Business Module, I used Tableau to visualize trends and mapping from Zillow Open API data. I created geographical mappings and other visuals to understand the housing growth trends in U.S Metropolitan Areas, to identify areas with high growth for investment.
