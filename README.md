## Metis Projects

This repository houses all the projects completed for the Metis Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp.

#### Project 1: Scheduling Maintenance w/ MTA Turnstile Data

Using SQL, pandas and matplotlib, processed 3 years of MTA turnstile data to identify the optimal times for scheduling maintenance projects. Data was scraped from MTA website. Provided visualization with explanation for recommendations.

#### Project 2: Yelp Comment Sentiment Analysis for Regression

I used Sentiment Analysis and NLP to build features from Yelp Review Comments. These features were used in Regression models to identify strong text features and predict User Review Ratings. I used Pandas, NLTK, Vader, BeautifulSoup, Selenium to build this project from Yelp Open API Data.

#### Project 3: Predicting Real Estate Growth w/ Tableau

As part of the Business Module, I used Tableau to visualize trends and mapping from Zillow Open API data. I created geographical mappings and other visuals to understand the housing growth trends in U.S Metropolitan Areas, to identify areas with high growth for investment.

#### Project 4: Machine Learning Classification for Credit Card Customer Churn 

I used traditional, supervised machine learning classifiers to predict credit card customer churn. I tested out Logistic Regression,
kNNeighbors, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Naive Bayes, and XGBoost. After baselining, I optimized an XGBoost model 
using hyperparameter optimization.

#### Project 5: Amazon Recommendation System

I built an end to end Book recommendation system from Amazon review data. I used NLP (NLTK, TextBlob, Flair) to analyze sentiment in Amazon review data. From these sentiments, I was able to build a collaborative filtering model that was trained using Neural Networks. The model is able to provide predictions on user-book interactions, and allows the system to recommend books to users that they have not read on. Examples are shown in the directory.
