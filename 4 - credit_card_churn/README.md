## Metis Project 4: Machine Learning Classification for Credict Card Customer Churn  

#### This project is part of the Metis Classification module

I used traditional, supervised machine learning classifiers to predict credit card customer churn. I tested out Logistic Regression,
kNNeighbors, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Naive Bayes, and XGBoost. After baselining, I optimized an XGBoost model 
using hyperparameter optimization.
